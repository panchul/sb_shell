# sb_shell

Shell/bash/cshell/etc. sandbox for variety of templates and tutorial snippets.

This repository could be a useful starting point for writing scripts, or demoing how to write scripts.
It could be used on its own, or deployed on a virtual machine within the workspace [https://github.com/panchul/workspace](https://github.com/panchul/workspace)

The ```/doc``` folder of the ```workspace``` repo has the documentation. 

I will gradually migrate the notes I have to this repository, and they cover different shells. So far the shells covered:

+ bash
     - date_formatting.sh
     - debugging_trace.sh
     - local_variables.sh
     - looping_feeder.sh     -  a randomized simulated feeder template.
     - output_color_text.sh  -  coloring of the output on the terminal.
     - stopwatch.sh
     - while_counter.sh
     - ... (there are more, just look at the folder)
